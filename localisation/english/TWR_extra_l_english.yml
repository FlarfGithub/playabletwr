 twrextra.1.t:0 'The Struggle Ends'
 twrextra.1.d:0 'A man sits in his room, writing his next work. Even now, he can still picture the countless souls that the Nazis claimed in their quest for Lebensraum. So many that he couldn't save. If only Britain had fought on, if only the Russians had held out, if only Treskcow had succeeded. So many what-ifs, but there was no point dwelling on it now. Von Treskcow was dead, but he was undoubtly smiling down on the new Germany, confident in its future. The man now turns to a letter he had recently recieved from his sister living over in Britain, about how she was looking forward to his next visit now that it was safer to do so. Dietrich Bonhoeffer smiled at the memories of his sister Sabine, and rose to leave. There was still much work to be done to fully cleanse Germany of the Nazi menace, but for now, the great struggle he and so many others had fought to save Germany from fascism was finally over.'
