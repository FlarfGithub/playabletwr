 NOR_Question_of_the_Quisling_Regime_desc:0 'Norway is at a crossroads. With a cautious political thaw underway, there's a sense across this nation that a great change is at hand. Even though the Reich is easing its control, Quisling remains direly unpopular. Although he has ambitions to create a strong, independent Norway under his control, others in this country and even his government may have different plans in mind.'
 NOR_NORTH_DEFENDER:0 'Watch on the East'
 NOR_NORTH_DEFENDER_desc:0 'We are a true nordic nation. We have roots in the regions of the east that Germany controls. As an equal to the Germans they should have no problem with us becoming a bulwark of the east against the bolshevik tide. We will request the Archangel region be transfered to us as a colony and military base.'
 NOR_Terboven_Recalled:0 'Terboven Recalled'
 NOR_Terboven_Recalled_desc:0 'At long last, the hated Reichkommisar Josef Terboven has been recalled to Berlin. He's the one person in Norway who may be more maligned than Quisling, so his departure is a welcome one. This will be a major step towards making Norway independent once more, but certain challenges are already arising within the party now that Berlin is no longer calling the shots...'
 NOR_1952_Party_Crisis:0 '1952 Party Crisis'
 NOR_1952_Party_Crisis_desc:0 'The Nasjonal Samling will be navigating the troubled waters ahead on its own without much German oversight. It's no secret to Quisling or any of his associates that his regime is despised by the general public. Even within the NS his standing is precarious, meaning we have to move quickly if we're to weather the coming storm.'
 NOR_Summon_the_Congress:0 'Summon the Congress'
 NOR_Summon_the_Congress_desc:0 'We have to summon the upper echelons of the party to Oslo at once. There's a non-negligible chance that the Samling will fall apart at the seams during the planned congress. Unless we're able to work out some sort of arrangement with Lie and Saether, Quisling will be in even more dire straits than he already is.'
 NOR_Quislings_Leadership:0 'Quisling's Leadership'

 NOR_Purge_of_Unloyal_Elements_desc:0 'Quisling is not utterly unaware of his surroundings. From his perspective, it is clear that he is not well-liked by certain people within the party.

 NOR_A_Deal_with_Hitler:0 'A Deal with Hitler'
 NOR_A_Deal_with_Hitler_desc:0 'Hitler has been exceedingly generous in his dealings with us. For now we'll play it safe. It's in our best interest to stay in Berlin's good graces. Allowing the Kriegsmarine to continue using our naval bases is a small price to pay for an independent Norway.'
 NOR_Take_a_Hard_Stance:0 'Take a Hard Stance'
 NOR_Take_a_Hard_Stance_desc:0 'We have been too easy-going. Hitler doesn't deserve anymore of our courtesy. We will harden our hearts and so shall the people of Norway. The push for independence will be painful but it is the only way to free our proud nation.'

 NOR_Assert_Norwegian_Independence:0 'Assert Norwegian Independence'
 NOR_Assert_Norwegian_Independence_desc:0 'Despite all the sacrifices we've made for the Norwegian people, our government has undeservedly gotten a bad reputation both at home and abroad.

 NOR_Disband_the_GSSN:0 'Disband the GSSN'
 NOR_Disband_the_GSSN_desc:0 'The GSSN's ties to the mainland SS are an active threat to Norway's stability and sovereignty. It's no secret that Jonas Lie and Quisling have never liked each other, not the least of which because Lie was appointed at Terboven's request. There's a real possibility that he and his depraved SS goons will strike again sooner rather than later. The organization needs to be dissolved as soon as possible.'
 NOR_Expand_the_Statspolitiet:0 'Expand the Statspolitiet'
 NOR_Expand_the_Statspolitiet_desc:0 'We should transfer the GSSN's policing duties to the Statspolitiet. Now that Lie is out of the picture, it stands to reason that this other organization will have to pick up the slack. As long as we provide them with increased funding and recruit more STAPO agents, Norway will be safe from Zionist mental derangement in all its forms.'

 NOR_A_Norwegian_Army:0 'A Norwegian Army'
 NOR_A_Norwegian_Army_desc:0 'Norwegian sovereignty can only be upheld through force of arms. We should expand the Hirden so that we'll be ready to defend our shores should the Reich and the Toronto Accord come looking for trouble. If we model our fighting forces off the Heer, we'll have the best possible soldiers this side of the peninsula.'
 NOR_Quisling_Neutrality:0 'Strong Deterence'
 NOR_Quisling_Neutrality_desc:0 'We have reason to be wary of the West and the London exiles as they may plan to strike at any time.  At the same time, the Reich may at some point disaprove of our policies and seek to take control of our country again. The only way we can prevent these incursions is by strengthening the defence along our coast and being prepared for the worst case scenario.'
 
 NOR_prepare_propaganda:0 'Prepare Mass Propaganda'

 NOR_Universim:0 'The Universim'
 NOR_Universim_desc:0 'Our Riks-President, Vidkun Quisling is a man commited to both philosophy and science. Likewise he wishes for the population of Norway to reach similar heights of enlightenment as he has. We shall begin preparations for us to cultivate a domestic scientific community.'
 NOR_Greater_Norway:0 'A Greater Norway?'
 NOR_Greater_Norway_desc:0 'Our Great Nation has endured centuries of oppression under the Danes and Swedes.

 NOR_War_Plan_Green:0 'War Plan Green'
 NOR_War_Plan_Green_desc:0 'Archangel, or Erzengelstadt as the Germans have been calling it, is part of our historical territory of Bjarmeland. Right now, it is only lightly defended. We could try and take this territory for ourselves during the chaos currently engulfing Europe.'

 
 NOR_Nasjonal_Samling_Crumbled:0 'Nasjonal Samling Crumbled'
 NOR_Nasjonal_Samling_Crumbled_desc:0 'The congress was nothing short of a catastrophe. Neither Quisling or Lie was able to attain a decisive advantage over the other.

 NOR_Return_of_Terboven:0 'Return of Terboven'
 NOR_Return_of_Terboven_desc:0 'Due to the NS's inability to resolve its internal difficulties, Josef Terboven will return to restore order to the wayward RK. Although he's not particularly well-liked there, he's the only person we can rely on right now who can set things right.'
 NOR_Reinforce_the_Reichskommissariat:0 'Reinforce the Reichskommissariat'
 NOR_Reinforce_the_Reichskommissariat_desc:0 'Norway's drift towards independence has sent the country into a downward spiral.

It requires Berlin's guidance.'
 NOR_Project_Nordstern:0 'Project Nidaros'
 NOR_Project_Nordstern_desc:0 'Norway will be redesigned from the ground up as a model colony of the Reich.

 NOR_Focus_on_Fishing:0 'Focus on Fishing'
 NOR_Focus_on_Fishing_desc:0 'If Norway is to be a productive colony of the Reich, it needs to start turning a profit. Norway's lucrative fishing industry should be expanded on. The country can offer the Reich a lot more than merely hosting its war fleets.'
 NOR_Declare_Our_Neutrality:0 'Declare Our Neutrality'

 NOR_Norwegian_Junta:0 'Norwegian Junta'
 NOR_Norwegian_Junta_desc:0 'This country lacks the stabilizing influence of a military man's guidance. This is how we'll restore Norway's integrity. The Hirden's discipline will give this country the sense of direction it badly needs.'

An ambitious expansion of the Hirden is needed at once if it is to become the basis for a new Norwegian military. We will draw up plans to found a Hirden navy and luftwaffe at once. We'll also institute an ambitious recruitment drive by making service compulsory for all able-bodied men both within and outside of the party.'
 NOR_Indepedence_Through_Might:0 'Indepedence Through Might'
 NOR_Indepedence_Through_Might_desc:0 'With the Hirden reforms under way, Norway is marching towards a better future.

 twrnorway.1.d:0 'On June 10, 1940, the Northern war was essentially over with the Reich taking control of Norway. The king and his government fled to the British Isles. As the Germans solidified their position, several Norwegian Divisions still loyal to the old Government refused to surrender began to engage German military convoys using Guerilla tactics from hideouts in the mountains, later to be joined by Norwegian SOF trained in Scotland in secret.\n\nJosef Terboven was selected to be Reichskommissar for the Occupied Norwegian Territories. For two years he ruled with an Iron Fist, stamping out all political opposition and establishing full-German Dominance across the nation. During this time, the newly established Statspolitiet started to round up Norwegian Jews. They were deported to the continent and never returned. Hitler and Speer had become obsessed with turning Norway into an Aryan paradise, and one way they saw to do this was to create a German city on Norwegian territory. Hence, the city of Nordstern was created, much to the dismay of the Norwegian people. As a condition for 'independence' the collaborator party, Nasjonal Samling was forced to accept this annexation. Quisling was thereafter instated as 'Riks-President' of Norway, while Terboven was also kept in the picture. The 'Riks-President', Vidkun Quisling is deeply despised and is widely viewed as a German-Puppet, but having a Norwegian as the leader has kept the major cities calm. Meanwhile the vast countryside is crawling with resistance and guerillas.\n\nBy 1952, the German Kriegsmarine uses Norwegian Ports as a jumping off point for access to the Atlantic, with Nordstern acting as the command center for all northern operations. The Germans are also continuing to exploit Norwegian Natural-Resources, in particular: Heavy Water for atomic weapons. Meanwhile, Nasjonal Samling is facing one of its biggest crisis since the end of the German-Norwegian War, with Quisling's faction attempting to create an independent Norway within the framework of the New Order, while factions within the government are torn on Norway's policies. Nasjonal Samling faced an uncertain future, but still posses the drive to bring Norway into the new age of fascism.'

However, the Gestapo failed to identify the supposedly suspect, but the local Director's order on 'success at all cost' resulted in the Gestapo agents using extreme tactics.\n\nThose agents entered a local hospital, attempting to use hostages to lure out the supposed rebel. When police officers responded to the situtation, they were turned away by the Gestapo agents, and the hostage situation escalated into systematic executions of hospital workers and patients. 54 Norwegians died to the Gestapo Operation, and it only ended when the director recalled the agents. Originally, the GSSN and Gestapo attempted to suppress information surrounding this incident, but the mere scale of this event meant it was impossible to contain.\n\n News of this tragedy shocked Norway, rumours are spreading, saying that the Quisling Regime and Nasjonal Samling did nothing to save their fellow Norwegians, and both the government and party are just glorified Nazi puppets.'

A waitress, looking rather surprised to see the leader of Norway inside the establishment shyly approached the men and asked what they'd like. Quisling grinned and pointed to an image of a slab of meat between two bread buns above the counter. 'Oh, I see... The Børger! Of course, Herr Rikspresident.' 'Call me Vidkun' Quisling smiled back at her. She paused, 'I'm Solveig' she said curtly, briskly walking back to the kitchen. Around 15 minutes later, the waitress returned with several 'børgers' for Quisling and his entourage. Quisling paused and looked at the Børger, noticing he had not been provided any cutlery. 'Um, Miss Solveig, how can I eat this? Do you not use cutlery in this establishment?' 'Um, no Mr. Quisl- Um! ...Vidkun, you use your hands.'

 #Old Stuffs
 NOR_ss_path:0 'Lie's Coup'
 NOR_ss_path_desc:0 'A victor has emerged in Jonas Lie and Vidkun Quisling's long-standing feud over the leadership of Norway. The chaos of the congress gave Lie a perfect opportunity to gain the upperhand. Now the Germanske SS Norge is calling the shots.'
 NOR_ss_path2:0 'Purge the Quisling Faction' 
 NOR_ss_path2_desc:0 'Quisling lacks the constitution to do what needs to be done. He's not well-equipped to lead Norway at this critical juncture. Anyone who thought he was needs to be dealt with, forcefully if necessary.'
 NOR_ss_path3:0 'Pan-Germanic Government'
 NOR_ss_path3_desc:0 'Norway should stand in solidarity with the Aryan nations of Europe. It is but a cog in a glorious, pan-German machine.'
 NOR_ss_path4:0 'The Norwegian Enlightenment'
 NOR_ss_path4_desc:0 'Christianity is a vestige of Norway's shameful past, one that we ought to move away from. We will offer \'Positive Christianity\' as a legal alternative for anyone who doesn't forsake the cross, but Norway will no longer be a Christian state. The dechristianization process will continue whether they want it to or not.'
 NOR_ss_path5:0 'Expand the GSSN'
 NOR_ss_path5_desc:0 'The GSSN is set to become the de facto police and military force of Norway. More funding and resources are needed to make it effective at upholding the law and defending Norwegian sovereignty. The civilian police ought to be more closely integrated into the GSSN as well.'
 NOR_ss_path6:0 'Establish New Legions'
 NOR_ss_path6_desc:0 'Lie has greenlit the creation of new SS legions to serve Norway's needs. The fatherland needs men who will fight and die at its behest.'
 NOR_ss_path7:0 'Norwegian Volunteers'
 NOR_ss_path7_desc:0 'We need recruits to fill the ranks of our newly-established SS legions. Any self-respecting Aryan man who wants to serve his country will be readily-accepted into our ranks. They will play a valuable role in facilitating Norway's cultural renewal.'
 NOR_ss_path8:0 'Embrace Esotericism'
 NOR_ss_path8_desc:0 'Christianity is a dead religion. This is a new era for Norway. We need a new faith and new ideals. Völkisch mysticism will replace the hollow words of those false Jewish prophets. The people of Norway ought to be better-acquainted with the Gods their ancestors worshiped.'
 NOR_ss_path9:0 'The Nordic Master Race'
 NOR_ss_path9_desc:0 'The northern Germanic peoples of the Scandinavian peninsula are the true Aryans. The Reich should be asking us to civilize them and not the other way around. We shall make this fact known in our state media broadcasts and propaganda.'
 NOR_ss_path10:0 'Our Norwegian Himmler'
 NOR_ss_path10_desc:0 'Heinrich Himmler is a wise man. We have a lot to learn from him and his devotion to the principles of national socialism. From here on out, Norway will stay in close contact with Himmler and the rest of the SS. Our cooperation and friendship will ensure a mutual re-Aryanization for our respective nations.'
 NOR_ss_path11:0 'Ordensstat Norwegen'
 NOR_ss_path11_desc:0 'The dawn of a new era is at hand. The former nasjonale regjering has officially become an ordensstat under the full control of the Norwegian SS. The implementation of Lie's ambitious plans are already underway. The black sun is shining brightly on Norway. The future is bright.'

 NOR_powerful_GSSN2:0 'Powerful GSSN'
 NOR_powerful_GSSN2_desc:0 'The Germanske SS Norge is a branch of Schutzstaffel based in Norway. Headed by Jonas Lie, the GSSN holds strong beliefs in Nazi racial theories and strong ties with Nazi Germany, often finding itself at odds with the Norwegian Government.'
